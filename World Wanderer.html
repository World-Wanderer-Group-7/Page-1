    <p class="large">"Atypical to Shoreditch and 'Camden" is a not an untypical comment about  East London. However, the area of Walthamstow (postcode: E17) is an exciting district in North East London and resides within the Official London Borough of Culture (2019) - Waltham Forest. Being the last stop on the Victoria Line, Walthamstow Central, with its recognisable art-deco fa√ßade, is easily accessible by all methods of public transport, from the underground to the big old red buses that flood LDN's streets.<br />
        <br />
        Having undergone major developments in the last decade, this daring district has all that you might want to explore within walking distance or a bike ride away. From the quaint landscapes of the lakes, parks and wetlands, to the radiant culture infused in its streets, markets and malls, Walthamstow is where 'it's at', a diverse population which brings together a colourful, close-knit community.<br />
        <br />
        Here are a few of our <b>Walthamstow</b> highlights, a creative hub for talent young and old.<br/>
